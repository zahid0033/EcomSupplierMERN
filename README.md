# B2B Ecommerce

This is a B2B eCommerce platform where sellers can connect with suppliers. Suppliers can upload their products and manage their organization's points of contact. The platform includes an admin panel where a super admin verifies suppliers' authenticity and assigns them a badgeâ€”Premium, Silver, or Goldâ€”based on their status.
